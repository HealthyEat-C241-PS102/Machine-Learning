## Fruit Classification Model Using VGG16 Pretrained

Our fruit classification model utilizes the VGG16 convolutional neural network, pretrained on ImageNet, to achieve accurate classification results. Leveraging transfer learning, the model benefits from prelearned feature representations, which enhances its capability to classify various types of fruits effectively.
